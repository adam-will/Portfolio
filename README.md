### Introduction
This repository serves as my portfolio. It contains my solutions to a few code challenges and two versions of a simple application core, together with their documentation. All code is written in Java. The repository is divided into two sections: 'Restaurant Application Projects' and 'Java Coding Challenges'.


### Restaurant Application Projects
This section contains code and documentation I have written for my dissertation project. It contains two versions of the same application. The main difference between them is how they handle processing of items and additional ingredients within orders. The first version uses a mix of enum values and inheritance. The second version implements the Decorator Pattern. The comparision of these two designs was the core of my project.

Folders 'Restaurant App - Base Solution' and 'Restaurant App - Decorator Pattern Solution' contain Java projects. Folder 'Documentation' stores project documentation, which includes use cases, sequence diagrams, and separate class diagrams for each solution.

### Java Coding Challenges
This section contains examples of code challenges I have worked on over the last couple of years. They have been taken from the CodeWars.com portal, which I have been using to improve my coding skills in Java and MySQL. Each example contains a short problem description and a URL link which leads to the challenge page on the CodeWars.com portal. I'm happy to provide further examples, if needed.
